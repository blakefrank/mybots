Here is the implementation of the 1d robot with a random number of randomly shaped links with random sensor placement along the chain.

Links with and without sensors should are colored green and blue, respectively.

To run it, download these files and run search.py.

This code still finds the fastest robot and evolves them randomly, which is cool. 

Here is a youtube link of an example of this working: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBEZR1dU2SQ
